hello world

最后一天在公司了,时间过得真快.

生活重心又要转变了.

迎接新的挑战.

回学校安心做毕业设计.

时间过得真快，转眼间就17年五月16号了

When you wake up in the morning you have two choices: go back to sleep, or wake up and chase those dreams.

Life is like a box of chocolates,you never konw what you're going to get.

If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking.

You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to.

:sleepy:

You can be happy or you can be unhappy. It's just according to the way you look at things.

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle.

The creative adult is the child who survived.

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

It's up to you how far you go. If you don't try, you'll never know!

What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it.

Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing
that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

Let your hopes not your hurts shape your future.

The fear of death follows from the fear of life. One who lives life fully is prepared to die at any time.

Whatever you're meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.

Do a little more of what you want to do every day, until your idea becomes what's real.

Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.

Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.

The journey is the reward.

If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

Bravery is the solution to regret.

When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven't.

If you're not doing what you love, you're wasting your time.

Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.

Overcoming procrastination

Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.

Go ahead, let them judge you.

Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.

There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

If you fear failure, you will never go anywhere.

The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself.

One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.

Always remember that the future comes one day at a time.

The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.

Stay hungry,stay foolish.

Believe in yourself.

Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.

The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.

As you think, so shall you become.

Be the friend you wish you had.

Never underestimate the ability of a small group of dedicated people to change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.

Fear, uncertainty and discomfort are your compasses toward growth.

No one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them.

Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.

If you don't like where you are, change it. You're not a tree.

You got this. Make it happen.

Jumping from failure to failure with undiminished enthusiasm is the big secret to success.

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

There is real magic in enthusiasm. It spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment.

Deal with the big while it is still small.

Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.

Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.

Do more of what makes you happy.

Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.

Use the talents you possess, for the woods would be very silent if no birds sang except the best.

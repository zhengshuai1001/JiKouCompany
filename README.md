8月28日了，学习进度还是好慢，时间紧张

When you wake up in the morning you have two choices: go back to sleep, or wake up and chase those dreams.

Life is like a box of chocolates,you never konw what you're going to get.

If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking.

You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to.

:sleepy:

You can be happy or you can be unhappy. It's just according to the way you look at things.

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle.

The creative adult is the child who survived.

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

It's up to you how far you go. If you don't try, you'll never know!

What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it.

Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing
that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

:cry::sob::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::frowning:
:innocent::flushed::kissing::sleeping::pensive::grin:

Let your hopes not your hurts shape your future.

The fear of death follows from the fear of life. One who lives life fully is prepared to die at any time.

Whatever you're meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.

Do a little more of what you want to do every day, until your idea becomes what's real.

Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.

Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.

The journey is the reward.

If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

Bravery is the solution to regret.

When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven't.

If you're not doing what you love, you're wasting your time.

Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.

Overcoming procrastination

Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.

Go ahead, let them judge you.

Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.

There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

If you fear failure, you will never go anywhere.

The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself.

One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.

Always remember that the future comes one day at a time.

The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.

Stay hungry,stay foolish.

Believe in yourself.

Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.

The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.

As you think, so shall you become.

Be the friend you wish you had.

Never underestimate the ability of a small group of dedicated people to change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.

Fear, uncertainty and discomfort are your compasses toward growth.

No one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them.

Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.

If you don't like where you are, change it. You're not a tree.

You got this. Make it happen.

Jumping from failure to failure with undiminished enthusiasm is the big secret to success.

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

There is real magic in enthusiasm. It spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment.

Deal with the big while it is still small.

Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.

Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.

Do more of what makes you happy.

Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.

Use the talents you possess, for the woods would be very silent if no birds sang except the best.

What makes you different or weird—that’s your strength.

Today is the most important day of our lives.

Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

Powerful avalanches begin with small shifts.

Within you is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself.

Do small things with great love.

If you lose, don't lose the lesson.

It always seems impossible until it's done.

This is the real secret to life—to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.

Never let your fear decide your fate.

A year from now you will wish you had started today.

The secret to your success is found in your daily routine.

Without new experiences, something inside of us sleeps. The sleeper must awaken.

You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done.

It's time to start living the life you've only imagined.

Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.

Children are wonderfully confident in their own imaginations. Most of us lose this confidence as we grow up.

Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.

Obsessed is a word that the lazy use to describe the dedicated.

If you get tired, learn to rest, not to quit.

Once you realize how beautiful you are, you will find it hard to keep the company of those who do not.

When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do.

The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.

Do more of what makes you happy.

The world is moving so fast that the person who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.

Failure is success if you learn from it

What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men and women. Our self-importance requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone.

The biggest room in the world is room for improvement.

To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it.

Do the thing you think you cannot do.

A surplus of effort could overcome a deficit of confidence.

Every dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength,the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.

An essential part of creativity is not being afraid to fail.

Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another.

People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.

We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.

As long as you're being a copycat, you will never be the best copycat.

Don't let yesterday use up too much of today.

In matters of style swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.

I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.

The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.

If you never did, you should. These things are fun and fun is good.

It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.

The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek.

Do what you love, not what you think you're supposed to do.

Every moment you live in the past is a moment you waste in the present.

Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.

Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.

There are seven days in the week and someday isn't one of them.

The right and wrong answers should come from your heart.

Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone.

Approach the game with no preset agendas and you'll probably come away surprised at your overall efforts.

The bigger the dream, the more important the team.

Do what you feel in your heart to be right. You’ll be criticized anyway.

If you want to fly, give up everything that weighs you down.

The penalty for procrastination is the loss of hopes and dreams.

Failure is just practice for success.

The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.

Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.

A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist
sees the opportunity in every difficulty.

Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.

Be who you were created to be, and you will set the world on fire.

Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.

Never dull your shine for somebody else.

No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.

Our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Success isn't about being the best. It's about always getting better.

The struggle ends when the gratitude begins.

When you judge others, you do not define them; you define yourself.

It's not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.

First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win.

There are no foreign lands. It is the traveler only who is foreign.

Speak in such a way that others love to listen to you. Listen in such a way that others love to speak to you.

If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.

This is your life. Do what you love, and do it often.

What worries you masters you.

Don't let a bad day make you feel like you have a bad life.

Every person is a new door to a different world.

Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential.

Never waste a minute thinking about people you don't like.

If I quit now, I will soon be back to where I started. And when I started I was desperately wishing to be where I am now.

In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists

Striving for excellence motivates you; striving for perfection is demoralizing.

All things are difficult before they are easy.

I am going to work soon keep it up

It doesn’t matter where you are, you are nowhere compared to where you can go.

So many of our dreams at first seem impossible. Then they seem improbable.
And then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.

If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.

Don't limit your challenges - challenge your limits.

Be slow to promise and quick to perform.

The death of a dream is the day that you stop believing in the work it takes to get there.

Incredible things can be done simply if we are committed to making them happen.

Be a practical dreamer, backed by action.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

We deem those happy who from the experience of life have learned to bear its ills without being overcome by them.

The past is done. The future has plenty of room for change.

The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old but on building the new.

Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the face.

If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude. Don't complain.

Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision.

A wet man does not fear the rain.

Mistakes are the portals of discovery.

The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.

Kindness is more important than wisdom, and the recognition of this is the beginning of wisdom.

The first step to accepting yourself is to stop comparing yourself to others.

The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have gotten.

What gets measured gets managed.

Never look back unless you are planning to go that way.

Lead with your strengths, not your weaknesses.

We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.

Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with mediocrity no matter how impressive their other talents

You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.

You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.

Be weird. Your strangeness is your magic.

On your journey through life, make sure your biography has at least one extraordinary chapter.

Anyone who stops learning is old.

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, bring others along.

Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth.

The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.

Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be.

Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.

Launch and learn. Everything is progress.

There is no small act of kindness. Every compassionate act makes large the world.

Don’t go through life, grow through life.

Don't let small minds convince you that your dreams are too big.

The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

Don't let perfection become procrastination. Do it now.

Live your dream, and share your passion.

A goal without a plan is only a wish.

The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us.

Reflect upon your blessings, of which everyone has plenty, not on your past misfortunes, of which everyone has some.

A head full of fears has no space for dreams.

Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.

If you're going through hell, keep going.

The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem.

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.

If you want to awaken all of humanity, awaken all of yourself.

A hero is one who knows how to hang on for one minute longer.

Keep your goals away from the trolls.

Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.

Create something today even if it sucks.

Of all the things that can boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday,
the single most important is making progress in meaningful work.

Nothing can dim the light which shines from within.

Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.

Courage isn't the absence of fear, but an urgent impulse to do something despite fear.

Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.

The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up.

Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

Adventure may hurt you, but monotony will kill you.

The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude.

Your dreams don't work unless you do.

To understand and be understood, those are among life’s greatest gifts,
and every interaction is an opportunity to exchange them.

The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.

There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy.
By being happy we sow anonymous benefits upon the world.

It's a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy.

Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.

What the caterpillar calls the end, the rest of the world calls a butterfly.

Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier

The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

If you change nothing, nothing will change

Adventure is worthwhile in itself.

Let go of those who bring you down and surround yourself with those who bring out the best in you.

Be curious about everything. Never stop learning. Never stop growing.

The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.

Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you are right.

It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.

Know well what leads you forward and what holds you back, and choose the path that leads you to wisdom.

Breathe. Take care. Stand still for a minute. What you are looking for might just be looking for you too.

What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything.

Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.

Try and fail, but don't fail to try.

If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it.

Always remember you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think

If you have a dream, don’t just sit there. Gather courage to believe that
you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality.

Life is a series of building, testing, changing and iterating.

If you can change your mind, you can change your life.

Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goals.

Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.

The greatest project you'll ever work on is you.

We tend to judge others by their behavior, and ourselves by our intentions.

To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.

Success isn't about how your life looks to others. It's about how it feels to you.

Love the life you live. Live the life you love.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them; that only creates sorrow.
Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.

I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.

Live in the present and make it so beautiful that it’s worth remembering.

Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men and women who find it easier to live
in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it.

Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at
the end of the day whispering, 'I will try again tomorrow.

What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?

The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.

Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way
to succeed is always to try just one more time.

It always seems impossible until it's done.

Your mind is a powerful thing. When you fill it with positive
thoughts, your life will start to change.

We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.

There are no foreign lands. It is the traveler only who is foreign.

Ruin is a gift. Ruin is the road
to transformation.

The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.

Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

Do not wish for an easy life. Wish for the strength to endure a difficult one.

Do the thing you think you cannot do.

Believe you can and you're halfway there.

The only way to do great work is to love the work you do

One day you will wake up and there won't be any more timeto do the things you've always wanted. Do it now.

Create something today even if it sucks.

Time goes on. So whatever you’re going to do, do it. Do it now. Don’t wait.

When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare
or compete, everyone will respect you.

Why fit in when you were born to stand out?

Don't limit your challenges - challenge your limits.

I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.

The biggest room in the world is room for improvement.

Be the friend you wish you had.

The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.

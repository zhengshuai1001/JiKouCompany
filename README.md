hello world

最后一天在公司了,时间过得真快.

生活重心又要转变了.

迎接新的挑战.

回学校安心做毕业设计.

时间过得真快，转眼间就17年五月16号了

When you wake up in the morning you have two choices: go back to sleep, or wake up and chase those dreams.

Life is like a box of chocolates,you never konw what you're going to get.

If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking.

You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to.

:sleepy:

You can be happy or you can be unhappy. It's just according to the way you look at things.

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle.

The creative adult is the child who survived.

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

It's up to you how far you go. If you don't try, you'll never know!

Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing
that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

Let your hopes not your hurts shape your future.

The fear of death follows from the fear of life. One who lives life fully is prepared to die at any time.

Whatever you're meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.

Do a little more of what you want to do every day, until your idea becomes what's real.

Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.

Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.

The journey is the reward.

If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

Bravery is the solution to regret.

When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven't.

If you're not doing what you love, you're wasting your time.

Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.
